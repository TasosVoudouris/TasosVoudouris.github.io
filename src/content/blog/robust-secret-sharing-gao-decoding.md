Secret Sharing is a foundational technique in cryptography for splitting a secret into multiple pieces (shares) such that only specific subsets of these shares can reconstruct the original secret. The classic example is **Shamir’s Secret Sharing** (SSS), which relies on polynomial interpolation over a finite field. While elegant and efficient, Shamir’s scheme is vulnerable to share corruption or adversarial tampering.

This report presents a robust alternative based on **Reed–Solomon decoding** and the **Gao decoding algorithm**, enabling reconstruction even in the presence of **missing and manipulated shares**. We provide a thorough explanation of the implementation and analyze its cryptographic strengths and trade-offs.

## Shamir’s Secret Sharing (SSS)


Shamir’s Secret Sharing is based on the principle that a polynomial of degree $t$ is uniquely determined by $t+1$ points. A secret is embedded as the constant term of a random degree-$t$ polynomial $f(x)$, and shares are evaluations of this polynomial at distinct non-zero points:

$$
\text{Share}_i = (x_i, f(x_i)), \quad i = 1,\ldots,N
$$

To recover the secret, any subset of $t+1$ shares suffices.

Standard SSS, however, does not by itself provide robust reconstruction from adversarially corrupted shares:

Plain interpolation assumes that the points supplied to the reconstructor are valid evaluations of the sharing polynomial. In practice, especially in adversarial or noisy environments, that assumption can fail. SSS does **not** provide robustness against:

* **Erasures** (missing shares),
* **Errors** (maliciously modified shares).

Even a single incorrect share can cause interpolation to reconstruct the wrong secret.

This motivates *robust reconstruction*. In distributed or adversarial environments (e.g., secure MPC, blockchain consensus, fault-tolerant storage), it is critical to:

* Detect and correct errors,
* Tolerate missing data,
* Guarantee correct reconstruction under weaker assumptions.

This motivates the use of *error-correcting codes*, such as *Reed–Solomon codes*, and decoding techniques like *Gao decoding*, which extends SSS with robustness properties.

## Gao Decoding: A Reed–Solomon Based Approach

Gao decoding recovers the correct secret polynomial even when some shares are *missing* or *maliciously altered*, provided that the number of faulty shares is within bounds.

Let:

* $K$: degree of the secret (e.g., 1 in Shamir),
* $T$: number of random coefficients added (security threshold),
* $R = K + T$: required minimum number of honest shares,
* $e$: number of erroneous (manipulated) shares,
* $m$: number of missing shares.

The decoder tolerates errors as long as:

$$
R + m + 2e \leq N
$$

A high level idea:

1. **Interpolation**: Construct a polynomial $H(x)$ from the received shares (which may be incorrect).
2. **Known Structure**: Construct $F(x) = \prod (x - x_i)$ using all share positions.
3. **Extended Euclidean Algorithm (EEA)**:

   * Apply EEA to $(F, H)$ to find polynomials $G(x), T(x)$ such that:

     $$
     R_0 = G(x) \cdot T(x), \quad \text{and} \quad \deg(G) < K, \deg(T) \leq e
     $$
4. **Error Locator**: $T(x)$ has roots at corrupted $x_i$. These can be used to **identify bad shares**.
5. **Secret Recovery**: Evaluate $G(0)$ to retrieve the original secret.

You can find the code into the `src/ReedGao.py`. Below we explain it briefly. Dont forget that you need *some* mathematical background to keep up. 


* Operates over $\mathbb{F}_{433}$, a small prime field.
* Implements modular addition, subtraction, multiplication, inversion, and division.
* Implements standard polynomial operations: addition, multiplication, division, scalar multiplication.
* Uses `canonical` representation to trim trailing zeros.
* Division is implemented using classical long division with normalization by leading coefficient.
* Computes the unique polynomial of degree $\leq t$ passing through $t+1$ given points.
* Implements the decoding algorithm using the extended Euclidean algorithm for polynomials.
* Performs decoding of possibly faulty shares and returns the original polynomial (if recovery is possible) along with an error locator.

Application to Shamir's Scheme : 
* `shamir_share(secret)` creates a polynomial of degree $T$, embeds the secret as its constant term, and evaluates it at $N$ points.
* `shamir_robust_reconstruct(shares)` applies Gao decoding to reconstruct the secret even with up to $m$ missing and $e$ faulty shares.

 A naive cryptographic analysis could be the following: 

(+) **Error Correction**: Can correct up to $e$ manipulated shares and detect their locations.
(+) **Erasures**: Tolerates missing shares.
(+) **Security**: Maintains $T$-privacy; any $\leq T$ shares reveal no information.
(+) **Robustness**: Suitable for hostile environments (active adversaries, faulty nodes).


(-) **Complexity**: Reconstruction involves polynomial division and EEA, which is more complex than naive Lagrange interpolation.
(-) **Performance**: Overhead in decoding logic and memory usage due to polynomial manipulation.
(-) **Finite Field Size**: The field size must be sufficiently large to support the desired number of shares and operations without collisions.

While Shamir’s Secret Sharing provides efficient and elegant threshold secret distribution, it lacks robustness against faulty or malicious inputs. This implementation demonstrates how *Gao decoding*, adapted from *Reed–Solomon error correction*, enhances SSS by enabling recovery even under adversarial conditions.

Such robust schemes are critical in real-world cryptographic applications, including:

* Secure multiparty computation (MPC),
* Blockchain validator security,
* Long-term archival with fault-tolerance,
* Adversarial distributed systems.
