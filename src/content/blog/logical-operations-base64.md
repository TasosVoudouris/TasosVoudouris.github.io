Now that we have learned the basic functions that we will use throughout our journey into cryptographic engineering, let's move on to operations between numbers. 

We will begin with a fundamental operation called **XOR**. Later, we will explore how XOR relates to **modular arithmetic**, but first, we will introduce it in a more intuitive way. Additionally, we will cover other logical operations such as **AND**, **OR**, and **NOT**, which are crucial in cryptography and computer science.

## XOR (Exclusive OR) Operation  

The XOR (Exclusive OR) operation is a fundamental logical operation used extensively in cryptography. It follows these simple rules:

- If two bits are **different**, the result is `1`.
- If two bits are **the same**, the result is `0`.

| A | B | A ⊕ B |
|:-:|:-:|:-----:|
| 0 | 0 |   0   |
| 0 | 1 |   1   |
| 1 | 0 |   1   |
| 1 | 1 |   0   |


### Example in Python:

```python
### XOR OPERATION ###
a = 143 
b = 218 
print(f'{a} XOR {b} = {a ^ b}')   # 143 XOR 218 = 85 
##################### 
```

### Explanation:
- `143` in binary: `10001111`
- `218` in binary: `11011010`
- XOR operation:  
```
  10001111
  11011010
  --------
  01010101  (which is 85 in decimal)
```

## Other Logical Gates

Besides XOR, we frequently use **AND**, **OR**, and **NOT** operations in cryptographic applications.

### AND Operation (Logical Conjunction)
- The result is `1` only if **both bits** are `1`, otherwise, it is `0`.

| A | B | A ∧ B |
|:-:|:-:|:-----:|
| 0 | 0 |  0   |
| 0 | 1 |  0   |
| 1 | 0 |  0   |
| 1 | 1 |  1   |

#### Example in Python:
```python
a = 143
b = 218
print(f'{a} AND {b} = {a & b}')
```

---

### OR Operation (Logical Disjunction)
- The result is `1` if **at least one bit** is `1`.

| A | B | A ∨ B |
|:-:|:-:|:-----:|
| 0 | 0 |  0   |
| 0 | 1 |  1   |
| 1 | 0 |  1   |
| 1 | 1 |  1   |

#### Example in Python:
```python
a = 143
b = 218
print(f'{a} OR {b} = {a | b}')
```

---

### NOT Operation (Bitwise Negation)
- The NOT operation flips all bits (`1` becomes `0`, and `0` becomes `1`).

| A | ¬A |
|---|----|
| 0 |  1 |
| 1 |  0 |

#### Example in Python:
```python
a = 143
print(f'NOT {a} = {~a}') 
```
(Note: Python represents negative numbers in two's complement notation.)

---

## `pow()` & MOD Operator  

The `pow()` function in Python is used for **modular exponentiation**, an operation that appears frequently in cryptography — especially in algorithms like **RSA**, **Diffie-Hellman**, and **ElGamal**. It efficiently computes:

$$
\text{pow}(x, y, m) = (x^y) \mod m
$$

This means: raise `x` to the power of `y`, then take the result modulo `m`.

### 🧠 But Why Are We Mentioning This Now?

It might feel a bit early to introduce modular exponentiation — we haven’t fully explored **number theory**, **modular arithmetic**, or **cryptographic protocols** where this becomes crucial. Don’t worry! We’ll cover all of that in the coming days.

We’re including it here as a **preview** of one of cryptography’s most important operations, and because it begins to show how computers **“wrap around” numbers** — an idea that also exists in **bitwise operations** like XOR.

> 💡 Think of **XOR** (in binary) as a kind of *modular addition*, where `1 + 1 = 0` (mod 2). While it operates on bits, and `pow()` on numbers, both use the idea of working **within a fixed range** — wrapping around instead of overflowing.

So while XOR and `pow()` look unrelated, they both touch the core cryptographic concept of **controlled operations within limited numeric domains** — one on bits, the other on integers modulo `m`.

---

### Example:
```python
### pow() & MOD OPERATOR (%) ###
print(pow(3, 4, 15))  # (3^4) % 15 = 81 % 15 = 6
################################ 
```
This computes:

- $3^4 = 81$  
- $81 \mod 15 = 6$

We’ll see a lot more of this when diving into **modular arithmetic**, **prime numbers**, and **public-key cryptography**


---

## `os.urandom()` for Random Bytes  
In cryptography, randomness is a fundamental requirement — it's used to generate secure keys, nonces, and IVs (Initialization Vectors). If some of these terms are unfamiliar, don’t worry — we’ll explore them in upcoming days in detail. 

For now, we simply want to highlight the `os.urandom()` function, which is one way to generate **cryptographically secure random bytes** in Python. As we progress, we’ll examine other methods for generating randomness and discuss how randomness is actually achieved and assessed in cryptographic systems.



### Example:
```python
### os.urandom() ###
import os 
b = os.urandom(8) 
print(b.hex())  # Random hex bytes
#################### 
```

This generates **8 random bytes** and converts them to a hexadecimal representation.

## Understanding Base64 Encoding

### How Are Images Transmitted Over the Web?

When creating a website, images can be embedded directly into HTML using **Base64 encoding**. This method converts binary data (like images) into an ASCII string, allowing it to be included inline in web pages and transmitted without needing separate image files.

### Example – Embedding an Image in HTML with Base64:

```html
<img src="data:image/jpg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEArwBHAAD/2wBDAAYEBAUEBAYFBQUGBgYHCQ4JCQgICRINDQoOFRIWFhUSFBQX">
```
This `src` attribute embeds the image using Base64, storing it as a text-based format.


### 🐍 Generating a Base64 String in Python
Python provides built-in support for Base64 encoding through the base64 module. You can use it to encode files like images or strings.

### Example – Encode an Image to Base64:
```python
import base64

# Read image file in binary mode
with open("example.jpg", "rb") as image_file:
    encoded_image = base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode('utf-8')

# Print a preview of the encoded string
print(encoded_image[:100] + "...")
# Output: A long Base64 string representing the image, e.g.,
# /9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQ... (this is the image data in ASCII format)
```

## Why Is It Called Base64?

The term **Base64** comes from the fact that it uses a character set of **64 unique characters** to represent binary data. To understand this, let's compare it with other number systems:

### **Base10 (Decimal)**
The **decimal system** consists of 10 digits:
```
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
```
We use these digits in everyday numbers.

### **Base16 (Hexadecimal)**
The **hexadecimal system** consists of 16 symbols:
```
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F
```
It is commonly used in computing, such as representing colors and memory addresses.

### **Base64 Alphabet**
The **Base64 system** consists of **64 characters**, including:
- **26** uppercase English letters: `A-Z`
- **26** lowercase English letters: `a-z`
- **10** digits: `0-9`
- **2 special symbols**: `+` and `/`

Each character represents **6 bits** of data, making it an efficient way to encode binary data in a textual format.

## Base64 Encoding in Python

Python provides built-in support for **Base64 encoding** through the `base64` module.

### **Encoding a String**
```python
import base64

# Original text
text = "Hello, Base64!"

# Encoding the text
encoded_text = base64.b64encode(text.encode('utf-8'))

# Display encoded result
print(encoded_text.decode('utf-8'))
```
#### **Output:**
```
SGVsbG8sIEJhc2U2NCE=
```
---

### **Decoding a Base64 String**
```python
import base64

# Base64 encoded text
encoded_text = "SGVsbG8sIEJhc2U2NCE="

# Decoding
decoded_text = base64.b64decode(encoded_text).decode('utf-8')

# Display decoded result
print(decoded_text)
```
#### **Output:**
```
Hello, Base64!
```
---

### **Encoding an Image to Base64**
Base64 encoding is often used to embed images into text-based formats.

```python
import base64

# Read image file in binary mode
with open("example.jpg", "rb") as image_file:
    encoded_image = base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode('utf-8')

# Display a snippet of the encoded image data
print(encoded_image[:100] + "...")
```
This will output a **long Base64 string** representing the image.
